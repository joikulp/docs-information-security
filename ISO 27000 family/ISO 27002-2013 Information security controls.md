## Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection â€” Information security controls

This document provides a reference set of generic information security controls including implementation guidance. This document is designed to be used by organizations:

a) within the context of an information security management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC27001;

b) for implementing information security controls based on internationally recognized best practices;

c) for developing organization-specific information security management guidelines.

---

A list of some possible information security controls with implementation guidance for each of them. A major revision was published earlier this year. Lots of good detailed guidance but with some limitations. Use with care.
