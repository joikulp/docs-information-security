Z>Start with creating email for reports, usually a shared mailbox with an email `postmaster@company.com`.

# Monitor results
Create a TXT file in your DNS:
Hostname `_dmarc` (So the hostname is `_dmarc.company.com`)
Value: `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:postmaster@company.com; ruf=mailto:postmaster@company.com`
TTL: 1 hour

The best practice is to have this on for a month to get reports on how your email domain is being used.

# Lock it down
When you are ready to lock down your domain you want something like this:
`v=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100; rua=mailto:postmaster@company.com; ruf=mailto:postmaster@company.com;`

`v=DMARC1`: DMARC version
`p=reject`: Policy is to reject all email that does not comply with SPF and DKIM rules
`pct=100`: Reject 100% of emails that break the rules, you can have this 50/50 if you like but email probably goes to junkmail.
`rua=mailto:postmaster@company.com:` Report to postmaster email

`v`: Protocol version `v=DMARC1`
`pct`: Percentage of messages subjected to filtering `pct=20`
`ruf`: Reporting URI for forensic reports `ruf=mailto:authfail@example.com`
`rua`: Reporting URI of aggregate reports `rua=mailto:aggrep@example.com`
`p`: Policy for organizational domain `p=quarantine`
`sp`: Policy for subdomains of the OD `sp=reject`
`adkim`: Alignment mode for DKIM `adkim=s`
`aspf`: Alignment mode for SPF `aspf=r`
