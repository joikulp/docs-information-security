# In Microsoft O365
1. Go to **Security Center**: https://security.microsoft.com
2. Click **Policies & Rules** from the menu
3. Click **Threat policies**
4. Click **Rules** > **DKIM**
5. Click domain you want to secure
6. Click **Create DKIM keys**

Wait while Microsoft creates the private keys for the domain.

Copy DNS information, it's going to look like this:
Hostname:  `selector1._domainkey` and Value: `selector1-<DOMAIN>-is._domainkey.<COMPANY>.onmicrosoft.com`
Hostname:  `selector2._domainkey` and Value: `selector2-<DOMAIN>-is._domainkey.<COMPANY>.onmicrosoft.com`

Then create this CNAME record in your DNS.

Now, go back to DKIM page in Security Center.
1. Click the domain you want to secure
2. Enable: Sign messages for this domain with DKIM signatures

You might get an error because Microsoft cannot see the DNS record right away. This usually takes up to an hour to work. But might take days, so plan accordingly.
